# com.sonosthesia.touch

Provides a number of generic interaction mechanisms which generate [channel](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.channel) streams. 

## Pointer

Uses the unity [EventSystems](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.html) to create, update and destroy event streams. In particular

- [IPointerDownHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IPointerDownHandler.html)
- [IPointerMoveHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IPointerMoveHandler.html)
- [IPointerUpHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IPointerUpHandler.html)
- [IScrollHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IScrollHandler.html)
- [IPointerExitHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IPointerExitHandler.html)
- [IDragHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IDragHandler.html)
- [IInitializePotentialDragHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/api/UnityEngine.EventSystems.IInitializePotentialDragHandler.html)

This is mostly suited to non immersive environments, specifically multitouch platforms such as phones and tablets. Also used for debugging and investigation purposes.


## Trigger

Uses trigger callbacks generated by unity physics to create, update and destroy event streams.

- [OnTriggerEnter](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html)
- [OnTriggerExit](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerExit.html)
- [OnTriggerStay](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerStay.html)

This is mostly suited to XR environments with colliders being attached to actors and targets. This is currently the most developed system with affordance systems, graphs and killers which enable different trigger sources to override or inhibit each other.

## Collision

Uses collision callbacks generated by unity physics to create, update and destroy event streams.

- [OnCollisionEnter](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnCollisionEnter.html)
- [OnCollisionStay](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnCollisionStay.html)
- [OnCollisionExit](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnCollisionExit.html)

This is mostly suited to physics based system, where objects bounce off each other. It is not really suited to continuous prolonged contact, for that use the Trigger system instead.

Audio descriptors for the sonosthesia project. Provides spectral energy [signals](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.signal) for Unity `AudioSource` and `AudioListener`.

Note FMOD integration should be added to this package with conditional compilation to avoid dependency.


## Spectral Energy Signals

### Simple Usage

For simplicity, drag the `ThreeBandAnalyser.prefab`` as a child of a GameObject containing an AudioSource component. The three ```Signal<float>``` components will be available as children of the prefab insance.

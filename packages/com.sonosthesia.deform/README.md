# com.sonosthesia.deform

Dynamic mesh deformations for the sonosthesia project. Implemented using 

- [com.sonosthesia.noise](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.noise)
- [com.sonosthesia.mesh](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.mesh)

This is an extension of the work documented by [Catlike coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials). See example usage in [demo app](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-demo-deform).

## Dynamic deformations 

Dynamic effect is achieved by lerping through noise generation seeds and cross fading between them. 

## Individual noise component control

The displacement generated by noise frequencies can be controlled individually, as well as through higher level parameters such as lacunarity and persistence.

## Heterogenous noise types

Different noise types can be combined arbitrarily. Job system dependencies are used to perform the summation once the deformations are caculated.

## Spline deformations 

Noise generated using the [noise](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.noise) package can be applied to meshes extruded from splines.

## Noise configuration targets

Noise configuration can be controlled using [signals](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.signal) to achieve dynamic effects.
